  <h3>Has Your Private Information Been Leaked Through A Data Breach?</h3>

  <p>
    A data breach is when our sensitive data falls into the hands of individuals who have no position 
    handling it. The release of our data is precious to any cyber predator ready to gain a collection of our 
    personal details. Check to see if your login credentials have been leaked through a data breach with this trusted <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">website</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
    If you received some troubling results or just want to access better security practices head over to our next sections to further evaluate protective measures.

  <h3>Password Security</h3>

  <div>    
    <p>Secure and strengthen your passwords with some of our best practices</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never use your username, real name, birthday, phone number, or any easily identifiable information in your passwords</li>
        <li>Don't use easy keyboard combinations like ABCD, 123456, QWERTY</li>
        <li>Don't reuse passwords across multiple sites</li>
        <li>Be careful with your responses for security questions, opt for an unrelated answer if you dont sense any responses to be strong enough.</li>
        <li>Use Two Factor Authentication/ Multi Factor Authentication - You can prompt security codes to your phone number or email to authorize that it's actually you logging into your personal accounts.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Memorizing a collection of login credentials isn't the easiest task, we recommend using a third party password manager so you don't have to worry about your new strong and unique passwords.
      <br>
    Take a look into two of the most respected password managers out there, <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.

      <p class="text">
        VPN (virtual private network) is a technology that encrypts your internet traffic on <br>
        unsecured networks to protect your online identity, hide your IP address, and shield <br>
        your online data from third parties.  VPNs use real-time encryption and send your internet <br>
        data through a secure virtual tunnel to minimze the possibility of anyone tracking what you do online.
