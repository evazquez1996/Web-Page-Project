    <h1>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h1>
      <p>
        VPN (virtual private network) is a technology that encrypts your internet traffic on 
        unsecured networks to protect your online identity, hide your IP address, and shield 
        your online data from third parties.  VPNs use real-time encryption and send your internet 
        data through a secure virtual tunnel to minimze the possibility of anyone tracking what you do online.
